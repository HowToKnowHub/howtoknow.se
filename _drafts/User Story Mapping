A user story is not detaild requriements of a feature. But a story of what a user need to do. I contains enough information for the people involved in the story to know what they are talking about. The Book User Story Mapping by Jeff Paton goes in to this and the life cycle of user stories, and the process around them. It is not about how stories shall be written. But how to use them, what's the purpose and how to make the most of them.

User Story Mapping is a method to break down a user story into smaller user stories. It helps us to find what to focus on and build first. By Mapping out the activities and steps of a story we can prioritise how we can helpt the user the most.
