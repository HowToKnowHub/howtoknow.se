# wwwBase

This webpage is built with [wwwBase](https://github.com/paven/wwwBase).

wwwBase is set up built on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. Lanyon in turn is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

This is set up as I want to start my new pages and blogs. You are free to use it but I recomend using Lanyon default.
